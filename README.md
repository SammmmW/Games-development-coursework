Important note: my asset folder was too large for GitHub to allow it to be uploaded in one folder. This means that each composite folder has had to be uploaded separately here - if you want to build the project yourself, you will need to put these folders back together.
The required folders are as follows:
- _Completed-Assets
- _Complete-Game (this one was also too big to upload to GitHub, and so four file aren't present in the folder and would need to be added back in: these are LightingData.asset, Lightmap-0_comp_light.exr, Lightmap-1_comp_light.exr, and Lightmap-2_comp_light.exr)
- Animators
- AudioClips
- Editor
- Fonts
- Materials
- Models
- Prefabs
- Profiles
- Resources
- Scenes
- Scripts
- Sprites
- Every .meta file (don't go in folders)
Additionally, for the AI to work you will need to import Unity's AI Navigation package, as this folder is also too big to upload to Github
Various assets are far too large to fit on github, and have been included in a OneDrive folder that should be accessible
