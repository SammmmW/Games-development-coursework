Important note: my asset folder was too large for GitHub to allow it to be uploaded in one folder. This means that each composite folder has had to be uploaded separately here - if you want to build the project yourself, you will need to put these folders back together.
The required folders are as follows:
- _Completed-Assets
- _Complete-Game (this one was also too big to upload to GitHub
- Animators
- AudioClips
- Editor
- Fonts
- Materials
- Models
- Prefabs
- Profiles
- Resources
- Scenes
- Scripts
- Sprites
- Every .meta file (don't go in folders)
